# spin_simulator
Simulating magnetic resonance spectra in an NMR framework. This version is currently still in development. 

# installation notes
The download will typically take between 20-30 min. Make sure to install the version specific to your operating system.
Ensure you are connected to the internet to download this program. MATLAB runtime will be downloaded from the web as part of the installation process.
Runtime can be a bit slow to run, especially on older computers, so don't worry if the program takes a couple of seconds to launch once installed! 

# Notes on the simulator 
The simulator is intended for the calculation of the spectra arbitrary spin systems in the frequency space, as well as plotting the energy levels as a function of the magnetic field.  You may already be familiar with NMR and the associated terminology. This simulator runs from an EPR simulation program called easyspin (Stoll et al. 2006: https://www.easyspin.org/).
